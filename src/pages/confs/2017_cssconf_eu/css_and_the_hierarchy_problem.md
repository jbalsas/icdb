title: "CSS and the hierarchy problem: What makes a CSS developer?"
description: "This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (“CSS isn’t _real_ development”), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS — both as a language and as a community."

##### Notes

**What do you do?**

Originally CSS = Design, but the web is growing so it becomes much more than that

> CSS isn't really development  

But CSS is more than that. It touches everything. Presentation affects interaction and experience

The repetition, makes it become an assumption, so the implications that one is harder and better than the other. We make wrong decissions because of that.

Undervaluing CSS has consequences
- For salary
- For teams
- For personal health
- For our products
