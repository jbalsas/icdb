Discover this and more tips to delight your users in the Browser Hacker’s guide to instantly loading EVERYTHING."

##### Notes

**Average on mobile 2017**
- 16s to interactive
- 19s fully loaded
- 420kb js

> Test on real phones and real networks  

**Goal TTI < 5s**
- Only load what you need
	- code-splitting
	- tree shaking
	- the frameworks take a lot of headroom from your app
- Only transpile what you need
- Order loading thoughtfully

> When everything is high priority, nothing is  

**HTTP/2 vs preload**
- Cache aggresively and granularly
