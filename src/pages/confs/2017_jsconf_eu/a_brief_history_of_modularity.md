title: "A Brief History of Modularity"
description: "“MAKE IT MODULAR,” they said. “IT WILL BE BETTER,” they said. Modularity is a term so common in today’s software industry, that it’s easy to uncritically accept it as a fundamental software development principle. but what does “modularity” actually mean? Where does this idea come from? Where is it going? This talk will walk us through the technical etymology of “modularity”, stepping through the intellectual breakthroughs alongside the fast spread misconceptions. We’ll conclude by exploring the implications of modularity’s ill-examined history on both its current use today, and where it’s heading in the future."

##### Notes

- Who can publish on npm?
- What goes into a module?

> People have no idea how or why to module but they felt very strongly good about it  

- Modularity is a way to address the challenge of thining if big deep conceptual hierarchies
- How small is too small? NMP is up to 2 billion downloads a week, so sth is working and good about small modules
- Tiny modules improve developer experience, but it doesnt come without a cost
- The use of modularity has grown to such scale that were being faced wih unexpected issues. Low level programming concepts are more relevant now than ever.

**The small modules philosophy**
- benefits library writers
- dd
- harms end users

> Software development is change management  

The goal of modularity is to hide the things that are hard (David Parnas)

> Write code that is easy to delete  

Is here a turn back to conservatism? Modularity is an old problem

**Modularize things for**
- Make things easier for you
- Hide the hard things
- Use the tools
