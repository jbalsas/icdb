##### Notes

- Many js engines nowadays that help competition and improvement
- Even thiugh being dynamically typed makes it harder to optimize, js is really fast -> JIT (generate machine code during runtime, not ahead of time)

**Optimizing Compiler**
- _Re-compile_ hot functions with type information from previous executions
- _De-optimize_ if the type has changed -> Don't change types

In V8, the baseline compiler is **Ignition** and the optimizer is **Turbofan**

**Object Types**
Optimized compiled code makes use of observed types (internal representation) to run faster. It accepts up to 4 type shapes or 312 in a less optimized version.

> Always construct the same type of objects!

Try experiments with Node and Chrome is possible

> Write code that looks like statically typed
