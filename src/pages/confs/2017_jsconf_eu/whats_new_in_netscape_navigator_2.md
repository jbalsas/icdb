title: "What's new in Netscape Navigator 2.0"
description: "How can we know how good we’ve got it without really understanding how good we used to have it? JavaScript was first released with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995 - can an application from today exist in the browsers of yesterday? Just how different was the development experience then compared to now? Is it feasible to implement a modern Web application in the browser that pioneered client-side development? What would code from 1995 look like rewritten with today’s JavaScript?"

##### Notes

1995 Netscape 2.0 was released. At the time it was mostly used for form validation, since server trips were expensive

**Goal**
- Implement TodoMVC in Netscape 2.0

**Challenges**
- The src attribute was not supported
- There was no dom api, you couldn't change it without reloading
- Error handling
- No console
- There were no arrays in JS 1.0
- Only global functions
- No addeventlistener and limited event handlers
- Styling was very limited
