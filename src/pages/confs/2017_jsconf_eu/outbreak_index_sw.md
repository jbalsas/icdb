description: "August 30, 2016, was by all accounts an average Tuesday, and release number 523 just a simple re-factor, but something went horribly wrong that day: bad code escaped from the office, and it quickly spread to infect tens of thousands, giving rise to a hoard of zombie ServiceWorkers! This is a disaster about a typo. This is a thriller about technology out of control. This is a tragedy about wasted CPU cycles. This is a cautionary tale about living in the age of ServiceWorker."
